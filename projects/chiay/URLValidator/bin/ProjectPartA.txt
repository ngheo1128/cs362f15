Part a: 

(i) testIsValid Function

	First, the method declares a new URLValidator object, and then asserting with a valid url to get correct
	feedback. In the do-while loop, a StringBuffer object is declared to form a standard format of a url .
 	Next, the for-loop will get the parts from 5 ResultPair arrays to generate urls for testing. The arrays are 
	declared as:
		(a) testUrlScheme
		(b) testUrlAuthority
		(c) testUrlPort
		(d) testUrlPathOptions
		(e) testUrlQuery
	The set up will then convert to string and passed to the isValid() method in URLValidator. If the isValid() 
	method return "true", the url will be displayed to the user.

(ii) Number of URLs tested

	The testIsValid() method is testing 31290 urls.

(iii) Building URLs to test

	A complete URL is composed by scheme, authority, port, path, and query. As mentioned, these parts are
	stored in 5 ResultPair arrays. Each array contains elements of composition, and the boolean expression that 
	identifies whether each element is valid or not. The for-loop then get each valid element accordingly and
	append to the string buffer with a valid url format, eventually form a complete url string for testing in the
	isValid() method.

(iv) Examples of valid and invalid URLs

	Valid   :- http://www.google.com:80/test1?action=view

	Invalid:- ://.aaa:-1/..//file?action=view

(v) Real World Test vs Dominion Unit Test

	Students may learn what they so called case studies from real world, so I assumed that the concepts of 
	testing from the real world are college are very similar. However, the complexity for both sides will
	be different. Students are currently in a learning stage, so they will perform more on basic testing. 
	The real world has larger and complex software that may need more complex testing.
