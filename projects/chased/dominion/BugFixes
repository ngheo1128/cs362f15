 Correcting bugs found by teammates:
 
 In the Adventurer card, my teammate noticed that the number of coins being picked up 
 was incorrect. I went back to the code and corrected the conditional which left "gold"
 from the treasure cards. The new conditional is this: 
 
 if (cardDrawn == copper || cardDrawn == silver || cardDrawn == gold)
	  drawntreasure++;
 
 In the Smithy card, my teammate noticed that the incorrect number of cards was being drawn. 
 I went back to the implementation and corrected the number of cards being drawn from 2 to 3. 
 Changed cards drawn from 3 to 2 in for loop. This way the loop will hault when the player has 
 drawn 2 cards instead of the correct 3 cards like this: 
 
 for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
}


 In the Council Room card, my teammate noticed that the number of buys was incorrect. I went back to the 
 source code and changed the numBuys from +2 to +1. This corrects the number of buys in the Council Room card. 
 
 state->numBuys += 1;
 
 In the Feast card, my teammater noticed that the number of coins was incorrect after the card was played. 
 I went back to the source code and corrected the last parameter from the incorrect 4 to the correct 5.
