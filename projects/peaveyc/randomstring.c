Implementing inputChar() and inputString() was relitively easy. After looking at the requirements to producing the result "error" printed to the screen, it was clear that inputChar would need to prduce characters between the ascii values of 32 (space) and 127 (x). The random numbers were sent through the mod operator, and then had 32 added to the result. The number was then type cast as a char, which was returned from the function. The same basic principle was used in creating the inputString function. Lowercase letters were generated, and were placed between the 0 and 4 indexes. a '\0' character was added as the 5th index to each string, since that was a requirement to producing the error message. I was able to produce the message after about 5 million tests.
