# smithy

Smithy allows the player to draw three cards, after which Smithy is discarded.

## Call tree/pseudocode
* cardEffect(smithy, ...)
    * drawCard(currentPlayer, state) three times    // card effect
    * discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0) // discard smithy

## Observations 
handPos designates the position of the card being played.


# adventurer

Adventurer causes you to draw and reveal cards until you've found two treasure cards. These go into
your hand while the rest of your cards are discarded. If you run out of cards, shuffle the discards
and draw from those.

## Call tree/pseudocode
* cardEffect(adventurer, ...)
    * repeat until the count of drawn treasure is over 2
        * if the deck is empty, refill it from the discard pile
        * draw a card and get what card we just draw
        * if the card is a treasure, increment the count of drawn treasure
            * else remove the card drawn and increment the count of cards drawn
    * now repeat until the count of cards drawn is 0
        * add the top card from the hand to the discard pile


## Observations
z counts how many cards are in the player's hand during drawing. The hand is treated as a stack,
with the most recent card added to the "top" (last index) of the hand.


# discardCard()
- accepts a flag trashFlag indicating whether the card is being trashed
    - if not, card is added to played pile
- the card is removed from the player's hand
    - if there is more than one card in hand and the discarded card is not the last card, then
        the last card in the hand is moved to fill in the empty space where the discarded card was


# updateCoins()
- counts how many coins are available based on the treasure cards in the player's hand
- adds the bonus amount
