Assignment 2


smithy
This card runs a for loop that loops three times and it calls the drawCard function each iteration.
After the loop finishes the smithy card is discarded from the players hand.

adventurer
This card process first runs a while loop if the amount of drawntrasure is less than two. If this while 
loop runs it checks if the deck count of the current player is less than 1, if so the discard pile is added
to the deck. A card is then drawn and goes into the players hand. An if else statement checks to see if 
the card drawn is a coin card and if so the drawntrasure variable is incremented. If the card is not
a coin type then a temporary hand holds the drawn card and removes it from the players hand. This first 
while loop then ends and a new while loop runs if the value of z (number of cards in temp hand) is greater
than or equal to 0. In this loop the number of cards that have been drawn in the current players turn are
discarded.


discardCard()
Is a function that uses the parameters of int handPos, int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int trashFlag.
If the trashFlag is less that 1 then the card goes into the players playedCards pile. The cards state in
the players hand is set to -1 which clears the card from the players hand. The number of cards in the players 
hand is then decremented. If there are more than one cards remaining in hand after discard the last card in the
players hand is replaced with the discarded card.


updateCoins()
This is a function that has the parameters of int player, struct gameState *state, int bonus. It initially
sets the coin count to zero then runs a loop that loops the amount of times based on the number of cards
in the players hand. The loop then checks with if statements if the card is copper, silver, or gold and
adds the approriate value to the coin count. Once the loop exits the coins total is added to the bonus.
