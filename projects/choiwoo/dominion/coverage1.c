please look dominion.c.gcov for better information.
Coverage testing included statements, and boundaries mostly.

Unfortunately, my unit tests were lacking in repeated testings
It just tested boundaries and tested them once ( for upper limit and lower limit)
statement testings were also common in my unit tests, but they werent usually
repeated either.
