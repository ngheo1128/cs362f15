I found the following bus in my teammates code:

Keenan:
1) In great_hall() the card is not discarded
2) In smithy() only 2 cards are drawn not 3

Tony:
1) In smithy() 4 cards are being drawn
2) In Village() 2 cards are being drawn not 1

It took some finegaling to get my tests to line up with my teammates, we had set up the input parameters quite differently.
