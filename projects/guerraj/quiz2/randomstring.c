/*
James Guerra quiz 2

For this quiz I created a pair of functions in the testme.c 
file for generating a random character and for making up strings 
using that first function.  In order to meet the requirements of the 
exit statement these strings had a 6th char containing to value /0.  
While generating the exit statement is unlikely it is possible using my code.
