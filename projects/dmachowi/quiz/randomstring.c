When trying to upload an Assignment I noticed I somehow deleted my Quiz 2 that I had originally turned in.
I am submitting it again now. I still have my original testme.c file but I cannot find my randomstring.c 
file so this is a new version.

I decided that I needed to generate all lower case characters and the characters listed in the test
cases at the bottom of the code. I used a random function to choose numbers in a range to produce
the ASCII characters and assign them to the array. After that I went to the inputString function where  
I created random strings using those characters with a length of 6 to return to the main function, the last 
char was always null. The testing worked an I eventually caused the program to stop, but it usually
took quite a long time. I saw some other students saying they had a lot fewer cases before hitting
that string to make it stop.
