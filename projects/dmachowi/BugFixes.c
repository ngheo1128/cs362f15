I started by fixing all the bugs found by my partners. Their tests found all the bugs
I had introduced purposely into my code. Some of the bugs introduced had already been
fixed because I wasn't able to get my tests to work properly. One partner suggested
adding a condition in the while loop that would stop the loop when the deck and discard
pile were empty, but I had already added the break statement if the temphand reached 
MAX_HAND of 500, so I left that as is. After fixing the bugs mentioned by my teammates,
there were no more bugs left in my refactored code to fix. I didnt't have a change to use
gdb to debut my code for this assignment, but I used it a lot for the previous assignment
in trying to figure out why my random tests were segfaulting, and I was able to successfully
figure out what was going wrong thanks to gdb.
