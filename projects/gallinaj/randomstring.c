Random testing quiz

My random tester uses two pre-defined arrays of values for the characters. The character array contains
the 9 values that the testme function cycles through. Each time the testme function is executed, one
character is chosen. The letter array contains the four letters that the testme function cycles through.
Each time the testme function is executed, five letters are chosen from the array, and then an end-of-line
value (\0) is added to the end of the "word".
