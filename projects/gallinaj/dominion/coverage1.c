I discovered that my tests were testing a measly 16-17% of my code! This is definitely not
deep enough for true bug-finding. However, I am curious as to whether these values are
cumulative or not...since each test file is only testing one function, it would make sense
that the executed line values would add up throughout the test. In mine it doesn't seem
like this is happening. I would expect that by the end of this test, more than 17% of the
code would be tested. I need to figure out a way to test whether an action has taken
place as well as if a card has been added to the hand or to the discard pile.
