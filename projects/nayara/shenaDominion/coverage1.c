Thoughts:
	As can be seen from the values above: coverage,
	in general, seems to be pretty low across all 
	unit tests. In part, I would attribute this to
	the fact that the number of tests implemented 
	at this point are quite limited (so far only
	covering four specific functions and four 
	cards). Nonetheless, each of the unit tests I 
	implemented have room for improvement and I
	think that they can be more comprehensive.
