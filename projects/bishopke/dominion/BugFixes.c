My teammates indicated the following bugs:

great hall: Card is not discarded.
This was caught correctly by both teammates.
I'm surprised they both caught it specifically, as my tests had trouble with this kind of specific catch.  I fixed the error.


Smithy: incorrect cards being drawn (one said 2, one said 4)
The bug was in fact 2 cards being drawn instead of 3.  I fixed this error.  I am unsure why one teammate said 4, but they indicated a bug with number of cards drawn, so at least they had it mostly correct.


Village: 2 cards are drawn instead of 1.
This bug report was incorrect.  The error was that the card added 3 actions instead of 2.  I fixed the bug.
I'm not sure if it was the way I refactored it or what. Only one teammate tested for village.
