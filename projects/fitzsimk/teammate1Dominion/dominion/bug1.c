I didn't find any bugs with the unittest.  Except unittest4 for some reason has a seg fault, but after it is running.  It was find before, but now is giving me errors.  There must have been something I put in incorrectly after.

There are plenty of bugs in Smithy, Adventuerer, and Council_Room, and a very minor one in Great_Hall.  I didn't intro a bug when I made the function Great_Hall.

Smithy had a bug with the size of the hand and what was expected.  Also there was a discrepency with what was in the deck plus in the discard and what was played.
Adventuerer had a bug in what was suppose to be in your hand and what was expected.

Council_Room had a bunch of bugs with what was suppose to be in your hand to the actions that were expected there was a discrepency.

Great_Hall seemed to have issues with actions and what was expected.
