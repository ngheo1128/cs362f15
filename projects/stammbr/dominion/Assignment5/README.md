/********************************************

All files for assignment 5 are located in these directories.

I kept the files for my teammates seperate, since I had to 
impliment the tests slightly differently.  You will see a 
few different ".out" files in both, and this was due to the
fact that I was working on my cardTests - while testing, I
found that my original tests were poorly written.  So, I 
updated them, commented out portions, and worked to improve
the various tests first.  (These details are explained in BugFix.c)  

The highest .out was used in each teammates directory to report
the bugs.  The unit tests for shuffle did "report" an error for
both teammates (and myself, actually), but this due to the 
function only shuffling a small amount of cards.  Also, there were 
errors reported in updateCoins() and isGameOver(), but I was unable
to locate / figure out where those errors are.  Instead, I believe
this is just faulty test writing.

My corrected dominion.c can be found in the Assignment5 directory.
I corrected the bugs my teammates found and one that was not.  I
was unable to find any other errors that I thought were in both
updateCoin() and isGameOver(), as I mentioned.  This does not mean 
that those are without errors, just that I could not find any.
