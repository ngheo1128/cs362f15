With this makefile, all you have to do is have all the files in this folder and type "make" 
and it should create all the needed files for this assignment.  Or, you could type 
"make unittestresults.out" as well, which shoudl do the same thing.  All the test results will 
be saved in one file called unittestresults.out.  When done with all of the files, then
you just need to type "make cleanall" and it will remove all the .gcda, .gcno, and .gcov
files.  Let me know if there is any issues with these files / makefile, since it worked fine
both on my computer and PuTTY.  Thanks, enjoy!
