Assignment 2 - Completed and saved in general "dominion" file.

Assignment 3 - All files pertaining to are saved in file named "Assignment 3", in the
parent file "dominion".  It includes a makefile, all unitTests, all cardTests, and
the needed dominion/rngs files.  Also, a newer version of refactor.c can be found
there and the coverage1.c file.  Both give detailed explanations of what I discovered
through this assignment.

Assignment 4 - All files for this program are saved in the file named "Assignment4" under the
parent file "dominion".

Final Part A - Located in hansejod's directory.

Quiz 2 - All files needed for quiz 2 are in the folder named "Quiz2".  There is no makefile for 
it, but can be easily compiled with gcc testme.c -o briansawesomeprogram.  Remember, it has to
be "briansawesomeprogram" to run correctly.  If not, I cannot be responsible for any issues.
