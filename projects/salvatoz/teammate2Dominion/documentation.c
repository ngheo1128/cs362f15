smithy: The smithy card implementation is very simple.  In the game, the card allows the user to draw 3 cards.  Similarly the smithy implementation, inside the cardEffect() function, calls the drawCard function 3 times within a for loop and then discards the smithy card using the discardCard function.

adventurer: In the game, the adventurer card allows the player to draw cards, until two treasure cards are drawn.  The treasure cards are kept, and all other cards drawn are placed in the discard pile.  The implementation for the adventurer card is also int the cardEffects() function switch.  It consists of 2 while loops.  The first used to draw cards until there are two treasure cards drawn.  The number of treasure cards are stored in the drawntreasure variable, that is initialized to 0 at the top of the cardEffect function.  Within the while loop, first it checks if the draw pile if empty.  If it is, it used the shuffle function to reshuffle the discard pile.  Then, a card is drawn using the drawCard function, it is stored in the cardDrawn variable, and it is checked in an if statement to see if it is a treasure card, by comparing it to the copper, silver, and gold cards.  If the card is a treasure card, the drawntreasure card is incremented.  If not, the card is placed into the temphand array, instantiated at the top of the cardEffect function, the card is removed from the hand by decrementing tehe handCount variable in the gamestate, and z, the counter for the temphand array, is incremented.  Finally, a while loop is used to emptied by using the discard function on the current players hand while it matches the temphand.

updateCoins: The function starts by setting the coins in the gamestate struct to 0, then looping through all of the cards in the current players hand.  If the card is a copper, it adds 1 to the coins variable, adds 2 if it is a silver, and 3 if it is a gold.  Finally it adds the bonus, added by action cards, which is passed in as a parameter.

discardCard: The discardCard function is actually used if a card is being discarded, or if it is being trashed.  First it checks the last parameter, the trashFlag, if it is not set, then the card is placed into the discard pile inside the gamestate struct and the number of cards played is incremented.  Then, the card discarded is set to negative one.  If it is the last card, or there is only one card left in the players hand, the hand count is decremented and the function ends.  Otherwise, the hand cards are moved up in the current player's hand and then the hand count is decremented.
