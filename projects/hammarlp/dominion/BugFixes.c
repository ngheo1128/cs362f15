/*
Aventurer:
	if statement to check if deck should be shuffles was checking <2 when it should be 1.
	This caused wrong shuffle behaviour 

Smithy:
	for loop condition was <=3 instead of 3.
	This caused player to draw one too many cards.

Village:
	Actions was being increased by 1 instead of 2.
	This caused wrong total actions at the end of card effect

Embargo:
	No bugs

Salvager:
	Number of buys was being decreased by 1 instead of increased by 1.
	This caused total number of buys to be incorrect.
