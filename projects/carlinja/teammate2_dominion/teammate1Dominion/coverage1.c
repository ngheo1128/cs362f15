Coverage1.c

Overview of my coverage findings.


The coverage for my tests came out pretty well. Each of them gets over 75 percent of total coverage for the functions looked at, many of them much higher. What this means to me is: I'm reaching most of the function in my testing, which is a good thing. What this also means is I can write much better tests, in order to reach 100 percent coverage for each function. Since my branch coverage is coming in at high percentages, that also means that my statement coverage is also high. 

My call coverage is not 100 percent. The majority of my printf statements are never reached, so I can't attain that percentage.

The coverage for each as follows:

unit test 1
95.83%
unit test 2
88.24%
unit test 3
84.62%
unit test 4
88%
card test 1
78.57%
card test 2
95.45
card test 3
88%
card test 4
81.82%


When looking at the coverage for Dominion.c I noticed that a majority of the code is never actually reached. Now, I've never worked on a major project like this, with this many separate files and code, so I may be off base here. The code coverage consistently comes in at around 15% for dominion.c, which I thought was very interesting/ surprising
