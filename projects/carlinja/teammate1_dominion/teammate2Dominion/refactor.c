Revision Documentation

Updated dominion.c
Refactored code for cards: adventurer, smithy, council_room, feast and baron. For each card, the card's effect implementation was moved to its own function. The function is then called in the switch statement. Added functions:
  -adventurerEffect()
  -smithyEffect()
  -council_roomEffect()
  -feastEffect()
  -baronEffect()

Updated dominion.h
Added function refrences that were created in dominion.c.
