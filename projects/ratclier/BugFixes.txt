dominion.c:

- Changed trash flag from 1 to 0 in arguments to smithyCard(). When set to 1,
  the discarded card was trashed instead of being added to the played pile.

- Changed trash flag from -1 to 1 in arguments to discardCard() in
  treasureMapCard() function. The two Treasure Map cards are supposed to be
  trashed when played, but instead they were going to the played pile.

- Changed the toFlag in the arguments to gainCard() in feastCard() to send new
  cards to discard (0). Was previously set to add cards to player's hand (2),
  which is incorrect.

- Changed cardDrawn assignment in adventurerCard() to add cards to the end of
  the hand. Was previously set to add cards past the end of the hand.
