// Test the adventurer card
//
// NOTE: YOU ADDED A BUG: changed cardDrawn assignment to not place drawn
// card at the end of the hand.
//
// The Adventurer card draws cards from the player's deck until two
// Treasure (coin) cards are drawn. If the drawn card is not a Treasure
// card, it is added to a temporary hand; if it is a Treasure card, it is
// added to the player's hand. At the end of the process, whatever is in
// the temporary hand (which contains no Treasure cards) is discarded.
// 
// If the player's deck is empty when the Adventurer card is played, the
// player's discard pile is shuffled and becomes the player's deck. (This
// seems pointless as the drawCard() function does this already.)
//
// From the Dominion Card Game Wiki (dominioncg.wikia.com):
//
// Reveal cards from your deck until you reveal 2 treasure cards. Put
// those treasure cards in your hand and discard the other revealed cards.
//
// If you have to shuffle in the middle, shuffle. Don't shuffle in the
// revealed cards as these cards do not go to the discard pile until you
// have finished revealing cards. If you run out of cards after shuffling
// and still only have one treasure, you get just that one treasure.
