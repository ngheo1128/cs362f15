// NOTE: YOU ADDED A BUG: changed the code that trashes both treasure
// map cards to no longer trash them (trashFlag changed from 1 to -1).
//
// From the Dominion Card Game Wiki (dominioncg.wikia.com):
//
// Trash this and another copy of treasure map from your hand. If you do
// trash two treasure maps, gain 4 gold cards, putting them on top of your
// deck.
//
// If you play this and you do not have another treasure map card in your
// hand, you gain nothing. Two cards are required to get gold.
//
// If there aren't enough gold cards left, you gain what you can.
