inputChar() --> This function picks a character
using the rand() and srand() functions out of the
array using only the lowercase alphabet and returns
it.

inputString() --> This function once again uses an
array of only lowercase letters to minimize testing
time running the program till the "reset/0" string is
generated. It terminates with the '\0' character
properly.

testme() --> Both a random character and random string
are generated as inputChar() and inputSring() are called
until "reset/0" with state 9 pops up.
