For the function test the overall coverage was rather poor. But for the specific functions I was testing I getting 100% in the test function and the functions they relied on. The only exception to this is the isGameOver function in which I got 90% code coverage. The card test have less mostly above 90% with two having 100%, one having 91.67% and the last one having 64.42%. The 64.42% was the adventurer card and probably needs a few additional tests to get it above 90%. The Branch coverage was very similar to the code coverage.  With the adventurer card sticking out like a sore thumb with 66% of the branches. The implications of the above results mainly point out that I should write a few more tests for the adventurer card to test it farther even though my test find the bug that I put in it. The other section would be that random testing is very good at getting good branch and code coverage. As all do that have 100% in both categories
