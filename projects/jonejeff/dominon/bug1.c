I found three of the bugs I implemented in assignment 2. They were relatively obvious when you stated checking the game state of what should happened against what did happen.  The forth bug I implemented looked like it worked but I could not find a prove what happened with the card except the hand had decreased by too as expected. This would be a bug with my oracle in this case. I found no other bugs.
