Andrew Bugs:

Smithy: Appears to not be adding cards, just discards a single card everytime function
is called so the players handcount decreases by 1.

Adventurer: If there are 0 treasure cards in the players hand before the call to adventurer
none are added.

Village: It appears that double the correct number of action cards are being added to the
players hand.

Kathryn Bugs:

Smithy: Appears that the function is adding one additional card more than that it is
intended to.

Adventurer: Appears to be only adding 1 treasure card to players hand as opposed to 2 
treasure cards.
