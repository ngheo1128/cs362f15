/* Quiz 2
The error message will print when the null terminated string input is 'reset' and the state value is equal to '9'.

The function inputChar() returns a char from an array of chars 'charArray'. The array only contains characters relevant in triggering the error conditions. The return value of inputChar() will increment the value of state if it meets the condition for the next state. State is initialized to '0' and will stop at '9'.

The function inputString() returns an array of char of length 6. A for loop calls the inputChar() for random chars to populate the first five positions of the array. Since the function needs to return a string, the null terminator is added to the end of the array.
