In HW3 I had already included a random tester, but I found that my
coverage was not very good. This week, for HW4, I explicitly included
test cases that satisifed the different condition of if statements
and loops included the card functions being tested. By doing this,
I was able to cover the entire functions. It had to check the gcov file
and look at the exact lines and number of executions, because the percentage
given referred to the entire dominion.c file, but even with that, I noticed
and improvement over last week's tests.
