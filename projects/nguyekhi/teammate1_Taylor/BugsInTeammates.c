Bug in teammate 1/Taylor dominion file

smithy card: 
- the player draw more or less than 3 cards
adventurer card: 
- the number of card in hand do not add up
- the number of card in discard do not add up

I have to change the cardtests, because other people name the function differently
and the parameters for those functions. But they are only minor changes nothing much
If there is a general guideline, naming convention and parameters.
