Bug in teammate 2/Tony dominion file

smithy card:
- the player draw more or less than 3 cards
adventurer card:
- the number of card in hand do not add up
- the number of card in discard do not add up
council_room:
- the number of cards in current player do not add up
great_hall
- the number of action do not increase by 1

I have to change the cardtests, because other people name the function differently
and the parameters for those functions. But they are only minor changes nothing much
If there is a general guideline, naming convention and parameters.
