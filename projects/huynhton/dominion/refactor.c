CS 362	Assignment 2

Assignment 3 (10/25/2015)
----------
For step 6 of assignment 3, I have already talked about the bugs introduced in assignment 2 below. 
I have made a few documentation changes on the dominion.c file itself.  Here are some of the 
changes:
adventurer_R // REFACTOR: 2 -> 3 (10/25/2015)
smithy_R//REFACTOR: 3 -> 4 // This now makes the user draws three cards (update on 10/24/2015)
^ I may have made things a bit more inaccurate by making those bug changes. But there should still be
bugs, nontheless.
	
----------
FIVE CARDS (plus Smithy and Adventurer)
----------
* This is a documentation of the changes I made in the following cards
Adventurer: Adventurer goes up to 1 treasure card, rather than the original 2 treasure cards.
Feast: Feast allows the player to now select a card worth up to 6 coins
Mine: The opponent now gains the mined treasure, not the user.
Smithy: The user draws 4 cards instead of 3 cards.
Village: The user now draws 2 cards and gains 1 extra action.
