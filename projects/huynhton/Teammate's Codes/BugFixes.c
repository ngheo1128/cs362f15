// Tony Huynh	CS 362	Fall 2015	BugFixes.c

/* Documentation:
	"Fix all the bugs that are found in your code.. First fix the bugs that your teammate found then fix the bugs that you introduced."
	This statement implies that all the bugs should be fixed, so I fixed all the bugs in my code.
	
	The bugs I introduced/fixed were found in adventurer, feast, mine, smithy, and village.  My teammates found bugs in adventurer, smithy, and village.  I also fixed the bugs in feast and mine, since we were required to fix the bugs that our teammates couldn't find with their tests.
	All the fixes were simple.  It helped me to have documented the changes I made within my code so that I could easily locate where the bugs were introduced.
	I used GDB for some of my code and can see the usefulness of it.  GDB allows me to check the state of a variable when I call break.  This allows me to next/step through the code slowly, and continually observe some of the variables I want to target. Once you practice this a few times, using GDB can be intuitive with the way it works.
