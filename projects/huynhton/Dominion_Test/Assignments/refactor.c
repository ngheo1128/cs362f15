FIVE CARDS (plus Smithy and Adventurer)
----------
* This is a documentation of the changes I made in the following cards
Adventurer: Adventurer goes up to 1 treasure card, rather than the original 2 treasure cards.
Feast: Feast allows the player to now select a card worth up to 6 coins
Mine: The opponent now gains the mined treasure, not the user.
Smithy: The user draws 4 cards instead of 3 cards.
Village: The user now draws 2 cards and gains 1 extra action.
