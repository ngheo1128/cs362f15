For my smith function my branch coverage was already at 100% and the randomtester maintained 
this level of coverage. My statement coverage improved however, from 87.5% to 100%.  I generated random 
numbers to be used for the current player (of 4 possible players), and ran the smith function 50 times 
using the random player chosen. This allwed my statement coverage to improve as their were more option than
before.

For my adven function my branch coverage increased from 33% to 100% and statement coverage improved 
to 100% from 72.41%. I generated random numbers to be used for the current player and the 
handPos, and called the adven function 10 times to run it using the different values. This allowed
my coverage metrics to increase.
