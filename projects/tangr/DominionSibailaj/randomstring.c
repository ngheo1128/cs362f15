First, I implemented the inputChar function to pick a random number between 0 and 32.
Based on the number selected, a switch statement with 32 different cases was implemented
to assign the char variable a value (alphabetic, brackets, parentheses, and a blank space).

Secondly, I implemented the inputString function to generate a random string of 5 characters
which calls the random char function each time and appends the end of the string with a 
null character.

I tested the function was able to reach state 9 by bypassing the earlier stages.
