/*
The reported gcov code coverage is 24.78%
For the code I did test, each practical scenario is covered. So the branch coverage is good.
The main reason why the code coverage is so low is because a small number of cards are tested and not every game changing function is tested. 
When testing a small number of functions, it can spread to other parts of the program. Testing the functions and cards I picked called other functions extending the coverage. This has positives and negatives. It is good that other functions are tested, but it doesnt fully test the full range of the functions not specifically tested (branch coverage). 
For further testing in order to get a better coverage, the rest of the cards need to be tested and the other major game changing functions also need to be tested.
