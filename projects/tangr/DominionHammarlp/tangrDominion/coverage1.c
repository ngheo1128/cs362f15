It goes to show that my testing is not strong enough to give significant coverage on the dominion code

I know one part is due to the endTurn() function but I am uncertain on how to go about it.
Also, after talking to the TA in person last Thursday, I left with a clearer understanding,

or so I thought.

I found that I spent too much time thinking about what he said in the end about the difficulty of testing.
Now I am rushing to complete this and will have to fix code later.

Thankfully I got all the code to work and I think I have figured out what was wrong with Assignment 2. 
I will need some clarification later.
