For Part a, You will be provided a correctly working version of URL Validator. Go through instructor video of explaining URL Validation testing.

-- Explain testIsValid Function of UrlValidator test code
The testIsValid() checks variable testUrlParts using all settings allowed by UrlValidator.ALLOW_ALL_SCHEMES, calling testIsValid(…).
 
In the testIsValid(…) it checks www.google.com and www.google.com/.
Then it uses a loop to do the following in order:
        	Form The full URL link
        	Test the URL link
Printing the current URL if it works if variable printStatus is true
For all URL link combinations allowed.

-- Give how many total number of urls it is testing.
4/9 prefixes
6/19 domains
5/7 ports
6/10 paths
9/15 path options
3/3 queries
 
19,440 URL tests are made.
There are 538,650 testing possibilities

-- Also, explain how it is building all the urls.
It forms the base URLs using six arrays, each representing a different aspect of a URL.
One array is for the ‘prefix’ or scheme.
One array is for the domains.
One array for the paths
One array for the path options
One array for queries
Each array contains a string and a Boolean. If the Boolean is true, then it will check for that part of the URL. If it is false, it does not.
In testIsValid(…) , it builds the URLs from the arrays. If it is to be tested, the said ‘string’ will be added if the corresponding Boolean is true.
incrementTestPartsIndex(…) keeps track of all the URLs made and sets the next URL link combinations from the arrays.

-- Give an example of valid url being tested and an invalid url being tested by testIsValid() method.  
One valid URL being tested is “htttp://www.google.com:80/test1?action=view”
One invalid URL being tested is http://www.google.com:80/$23/file”
        	“$23/file” path options failed
        	“/test1//file” path options also failed

-- Do you think that a real world test (URL Validator's testIsValid() test in this case) is very different than the unit tests and card tests that we wrote (in terms of concepts & complexity)?  Explain in few lines.
I believe it is. The scope is completely different (at least for mine). Also, testing validity is different from testing to check if something is acting as expected.
Submit a file called ProjectPartA.txt with your writeup. You can submit the file under the folder URLValidator within on ONID directory. (How to setup this folder will be explained soon.)
