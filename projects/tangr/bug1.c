feast 
    has an interesting bug involving "played"
	is there a misconception on my part on what is considered "played"
	this has not been determined
	
there is a distinct difference between "played" and "discarded"
	it is not easy to understand codewise and difficult to check due to the "endturn()" not effectively tested yet
