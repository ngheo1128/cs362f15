RANDOM TEST RESULTS
All random test coverage results were from a 500 count
test run.

**************************************************************

Steward Card Effect Random Testing Results:
Lines executed:22.92% of 650
Branches executed:19.18% of 417
Taken at least once:16.31% of 417

Steward Card Effect Unit Testing Results:
Lines executed:19.85% of 650
Branches executed:18.23% of 417
Taken at least once:14.63% of 417

Steward Card Effect Increase in Coverage with Random Testing:
Lines executed:3.07% of 650
Branches executed:0.95% of 417
Taken at least once:1.68% of 417

Improvements in coverage resulted from a random deck, discard,
and hand count. Coverage was further improved by randomizing
the the choice of the option 3 to trash any 2 cards from the
hand.

Adventurer Card Effect Random Testing Results:
Lines executed:21.69% of 650
Branches executed:19.66% of 417
Taken at least once:17.03% of 417

Adventurer Card Effect Unit Testing Results:
Lines executed:18.62% of 650
Branches executed:18.71% of 417

Steward Card Effect Increase in Coverage with Random Testing:
Lines executed:3.07% of 650
Branches executed:0.95% of 417
Taken at least once:1.92% of 417

Improvements in coverage resulted from a random deck, discard,
and hand count. Coverage was further improved by randomizing
the type of treasure cards in the hand.

**************************************************************

Random testing resulted in overall improvements in line and 
branch coverage by randomizing hand count, deck count, discard
count, player, and seed. All tests resulted in the expected
errors that were the results of bugs introducted in an 
earlier assignment.
