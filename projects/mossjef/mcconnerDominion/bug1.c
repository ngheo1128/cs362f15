Assignment 3

In the execution of my unit tests, I found 4 bugs, in 4 different functions.

Unittest1.c shuffle -
	None yet.

Unittest2.c updateCoins -
	None yet.

Unittest3.c isGameOver – 
	The game does not always end when 3 supply piles are empty. If one of the empty supply piles is card #25, 26, or 27, the game will not end.

Unittest4.c discardCard -
	The card does not get placed in the discard pile. The discard pile shows empty even though it should have 1 card in it.

Cardtest1.c smithyCard -
	None yet.

Cardtest2.c adventurerCard -
	The adventurer card isn’t discarded after it is played. The card remains in the players’ hand.

Cardtest3.c council_roomCard -
	None yet.

Cardtest4.c villageCard -
	Actions are not decreased. They should be decreased by 1.
